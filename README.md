# SCons PkgConfig Utils

This module is a support module for SCons builds.

The standard support for using pkg-config in SCons assumes C or C++, hence these extra tools to assist
generally.

Install by checkout out the repository and then creating symbolic link to the Python module in either
~/.scons/site\_scons (for use in all personal projects), or <project-directory>/site\_scons.
